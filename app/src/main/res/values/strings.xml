    <string name="dummy_text">Food blogs are where cookbooks meet lifestyle magazines. The bloggers range from home cooks who enjoy sharing their favorite creations, to the famous top chef who uses the virtual space to share their ultimate recipes and top tips.

Take, for example, the famous duo Anders Husa and Kaitlin Orr , who have made food blogging a daily endeavor, a travel destination, and, ultimately, a life style.

Or Hami Sharafi, one of the most dedicated Persian food ambassadors, who shares his first-hand knowledge of his family-operated restaurant and courses in cooking and hospitality in his blog “from the inside”.

What is common among them all is that they were born out of a passion for food. Without a doubt, the world is a better place now they are in it – and definitely a more delicious one.

Now packed with stunning photography and detailed recipes, food blogs have come a long way over the past decade or so to meet the exacting demands of virtual food lovers.</string>
